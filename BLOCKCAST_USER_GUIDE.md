# BlockCast - Prediction Markets Platform Documentation

## Overview

BlockCast is a decentralized prediction market platform where users can create markets, trade on future events, and earn rewards. Think of it as a marketplace where people bet on real-world outcomes like "Will Bitcoin reach $100,000?" or "Will it rain tomorrow in New York?"

## Core Concepts

### What is a Prediction Market?
A prediction market allows people to trade shares that represent the probability of future events. If you think Bitcoin will reach $100k, you buy "YES" shares. If you think it won't, you buy "NO" shares. The price reflects what the crowd believes is the probability of that event happening.

### How Does Pricing Work?
- **Simple Rule**: Price = Probability
- If YES shares cost $0.75, the market believes there's a 75% chance the event will happen
- If NO shares cost $0.25, there's a 25% chance it won't happen
- Prices always add up to $1.00

## Smart Contracts Explained

### 1. **PredictionMarketFactory** - The Market Creator

**What it does**: This is the central hub that creates all prediction markets.

**Key Features**:
- **Market Creation**: Anyone can propose a new prediction market
- **Quality Control**: Admins can pause market creation if needed
- **Reward System**: Automatically rewards market creators with CAST tokens when their market resolves successfully
- **Authorization**: Manages which markets are legitimate

**User Experience**:
- Submit a question like "Will Team A win the championship?"
- Set an end date (when betting stops)
- The factory creates your market and authorizes it
- You get rewarded with governance tokens when it resolves

### 2. **PredictionMarket** - Individual Betting Markets

**What it does**: Each market represents one specific question where people can trade YES/NO positions.

**How Trading Works**:
1. **Market Opens**: People can buy YES or NO shares
2. **Dynamic Pricing**: Prices change based on demand (more YES buyers = higher YES price)
3. **Market Closes**: No more trading after the deadline
4. **Resolution**: Admins determine the outcome
5. **Payouts**: Winners get their share of the pot

**Smart Features**:
- **Two-Stage Resolution**: First a preliminary result, then final confirmation after dispute period
- **Confidence Scoring**: Admins can express how certain they are (0-100%)
- **Protocol Fees**: Small percentage goes to platform treasury
- **Proportional Payouts**: Winners split the pot based on their stake

**Example Flow**:
- Market: "Will Bitcoin hit $100k by Dec 31?"
- You buy 100 YES shares at $0.60 each = $60 spent
- Market resolves to YES
- You get back: (your shares / total winning shares) Ã— remaining pot

### 3. **BetNFT** - Digital Collectibles for Your Bets

**What it does**: Every time you buy shares, you get a unique NFT that represents your position.

**Why NFTs?**:
- **Proof of Ownership**: Your NFT proves you own specific shares
- **Secondary Market**: You can sell your position to others before market closes
- **Collectible Value**: Each NFT has unique metadata about your bet
- **Transferable**: Trade your betting positions like trading cards

**NFT Features**:
- **Automatic Creation**: Get an NFT every time you place a bet
- **Rich Metadata**: Shows market, shares, position (YES/NO), timestamp
- **Marketplace**: List your NFT for sale at any price you want
- **Trading Restrictions**: Can only trade while market is still open

**Secondary Market Example**:
- You buy 500 YES shares when price is $0.50
- Price goes up to $0.80 (looking good for YES!)
- Instead of waiting for resolution, you list your NFT for $450
- Someone buys it, you get $450 cash now, they get the 500 shares

### 4. **Treasury** - Platform Revenue Management

**What it does**: Collects and manages all platform fees from trading activity.
